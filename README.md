# wgsl-noise

This repository contains the noise functions that were converted from GLSL to WGSL, sourced from [ashima/webgl-noise](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise) and [stegu/webgl-noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise).

Please note that it currently does not include `psrdnoise` since the original author has already provided a version converted to WGSL (please refer to: [stegu/psrdnoise](https://github.com/stegu/psrdnoise)).

Special thanks to [Stefan Gustavson](https://github.com/stegu) and [Ian McEwan](https://github.com/ijm), [Ashima Arts](https://github.com/ashima) for their contributions to the community! This repository focuses solely on the language porting.

Be sure to visit [ashima/webgl-noise](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise), [stegu/webgl-noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise), and [stegu/psrdnoise](https://github.com/stegu/psrdnoise) for more information!

Finally, a big thank you to [Stefan Gustavson](https://github.com/stegu) for the help!
